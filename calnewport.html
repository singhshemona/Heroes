	<p>Calvin (Cal) Newport is an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Georgetown University, 
	the author of three 'How to' books targeted at high school and college students, author of "So Good They Can't Ignore You," 
	and author of the 'Study Hacks' blog. Newport completed his undergraduate studies at Dartmouth College in 2004 and received a Ph.D. 
	from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009 in computer science. He then spent two years as a post-doctoral associate at the MIT 
	computer science department. In 2011, he joined Georgetown University as an assistant professor of computer science. Newport's first book, 'How to Win at College,' 
	was published by Random House in 2005. This book provided general advice for getting the most out of one's college experience, including academics, extracurricular activities, 
	and networking with friends. Newport's second book, 'How to Become a Straight-A Student,' was published by Random House in 2006. Unlike its predecessor, 
	this book was narrowly focused on achieving academic success in college. Newport's third book, 'How to Be a High-School Superstar,' focused on explaining a 
	"relaxed superstar" strategy to high school students that would allow them both to shine in college 
	admissions and to have a less stressful high school life. Newport's fourth book, 'So Good They Can't Ignore You,' was published by Grand Central Publishing, 
	a division of the Hachette Book Group USA, in 2012.</p>

	<h2>Importance</h2>

	<div class="paragraph2">
	<p>Cal Newport has taught me so much about how to approach life and schooling in a safer manner. Throughout his constant blogs and books, I have gained a true insight
	about what it takes to be a successful student. I also now understand the extent to which one has to focus to do well. I especially am thankful to how much he has taught 
	me about productivity. I used to play victim when it came to being productive, and assumed that one only procrastinates if he/she is not smart or capable enough but it
	actually has nothing to do with that. Procrastination is simply your brain telling you that your plan is not a good one. If you find that you are not getting much done, it is
	most likely because you have not put much effort into making sure it will work out. He has shaped much of the way I think about school and education and made me see
	that doing well in school is totally possible by putting in a reasonable amount of effort. His books, "How to Win at College" and "How to be a Straight-A student" helped
	me to see the realistic side of learning. I used think the only way to do well is by putting in a crazy amount of work into my classes, but I now know it is not 
	about working harder, but working smarter. Pacing yourself out and understanding that there are different ways to approach different subject material is essential to
	doing well. You cannot assume that things will just come naturally, but rather you must work smartly to get the most out of your classes.</p>
